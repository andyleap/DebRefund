DebRefund
=========

Basically, put parachutes on stuff!

Funds will get added, and messages will appear in the message box, as debris is "recovered".
There are 3 regions of recovery, based on mass to parachute drag ratio.

Green is landed safe, and does 88% to 9% refund based on distance from KSC, yellow is landed with some damage, and yields 90% to 50% of the green level, and red is it slammed into the ground, no refund.

Green is >90 drag to mass ratio, Yellow is >70 drag to mass ratio, and Red is everything else.
